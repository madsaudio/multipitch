Multi-Pitch Estimation Toolbox
Version 1.0 29-Jun-2009

This is the README file for the Multi-Pitch Estimation toolbox for MATLAB
for the book M. G. Christensen and A. Jakobsson, Multi-Pitch Estimation, 
Morgan & Claypool Publishers, 2009. The toolbox is a collection of MATLAB 
scripts and functions for estimating the parameters of periodic signals. 
For clarity, we have opted to keep the files a simple as possible while 
sacrificing computational efficiency and performance; the point of these 
files is to illustrate the various estimation principles. The users may 
wish to modify the files to fit their needs. We ask that you please cite 
our book and/or the appropriate papers when using these methods.  If you 
find any bugs or errors or have any suggestions or comments, please send 
Mads G. Christensen an email at mgc@es.aau.dk. The toolbox contains the 
MATLAB functions listed below. For help on how to use the individual 
functions, use MATLAB's help function and/or see the example files.
